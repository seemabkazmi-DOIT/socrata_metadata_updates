hpun-upnm,Fish Blockage Locations,"In 1987, the Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed by states within the Chesapeake Bay region including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia. This agreement included commitments for providing fish passage within each state: ""to provide for fish passage at dams, and remove stream blockages wherever necessary to restore passage for migratory fish."" With this humble beginning, the Chesapeake Bay states set a goal to reopen a total of 1,357 miles of historical spawning grounds by the year 2003. Maryland's portion of this goal is to reopen 388.65 miles of stream. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Fish Passage Program has taken this commitment very seriously; to date the Program has completed 61 projects, reopening a total 348.9 miles of upstream spawning habitat. Several projects scheduled to be completed by 2003 will allow the Program to not only meet but also exceed the goal set forth by the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Meeting this goal has been a cooperative effort between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, State Highway Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service - National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, Department of Interior - US Fish & Wildlife, Environmental Protection Agency, Chesapeake Bay Program, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, University Maryland and a multitude of others including private citizens, local watershed groups and local governments.",J.B.

sgap-qdpw,Baltimore 30 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2011 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Baltimore County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Baltimore County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

888c-gjd9,Scenic Natural Views,"Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland’s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters.

8iff-ugwi,Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Lines,"MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Lines data consists of linear geometric features which represent traffic count sections along public roadways in the State of Maryland.  Traffic counts are performed in order to calculate the annual average daily traffic (AADT), annual average weekday traffic (AAWDT), and AADT based on vehicle class (current year only) for sections along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Overall percent utilization, percent utilization based on vehicle class, and truck-specific percent utilization are showcased as statistical metrics for each road section where applicable. Ten years of historic AADT and AAWDT traffic count information is also available for each road section where applicable. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), located throughout Maryland. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous ATRs, and short-term traffic counts. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA). A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where “0” represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), “1” represents the count taken in 2013, “2” represents the count taken in 2012, “3” represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is a strategic resource for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), as well as many other State and local government agencies. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of State highway improvement and safety programs. The MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet MDOT SHA’s long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2019.

MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI), currently of Frederick, Md., to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). The 2000 baseline which were not created seaward includes all Maryland shoreline areas except for Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Harford and Prince George's counties currently. The newest (2015) updated baselines were created offshore (seaward) of the shorelines utilized in DSAS analysis. The baselines were created by 1) buffering at a distance of 10m around the master shoreline feature class converting the buffer polygon to a line, and erasing the landward portion of the buffer line; and 2) manually digitizing baselines up the centerline of tributaries/rivers and other areas where baselines were needed but the buffer-created baselines did not reach.",J.B.

6pfn-7c2t,Zip Codes - 5 Digit,"This dataset is the Maryland ZIP codes based on the most current MD PropertyView data.  In 1993, the Maryland Department of Planning and the Maryland State Highway Administration entered into a Data Base Usage Agreement with Bell Atlantic and Data Chromatics, Inc. to develop an enhanced street address map for Maryland. Zip Code boundary area files were one of the products derived from this partnership. The resulting boundary area files were intended to improve the cartographic quality and accuracy of the zip code boundary area files derived from the U.S. Census Bureau's post 1990 Census TIGER\Line Files (based on the Census Bureau's zip code tabulation areas, ZCTAs). Subsequent iterative improvements to the Zip Code boundary area files have been made using premise address information associated with mapped parcel records as provided in the Maryland Department of Planning's MdProperty View GIS product. The resulting files are meant to serve as a ""good approximation"" of zip codes as polygons (which in reality they are not) but are not official Zip Code maps and are not meant to be a substitute for any products offered by the U.S. Postal Service, the official source for zip code information. While there are no restrictions on their use we do recommend that they are best used with MdProperty View and that MDP makes no guarantee or warranty regarding the files.

m38f-hdhd,Metropolitan Planning Organizations Boundaries,"Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland’s borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries’ data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).  

A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (“3‑C”) planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions. 

The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Maryland's MPOs are as follows: National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB), Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB), Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO), Hagerstown/Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO), Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO), Salisbury/Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S/WMPO), and Calvert-St. Mary’s Metropolitan Planning Organization (C-SMMPO).  

Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). Being a subset of the USDOT's NTAD, an annual update of Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is performed by TSO in close coordination with each MPO, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). MPO Boundaries data is a strategic resource for the USDOT, FHWA, MDOT, as well as many other National, State, and local government agencies. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is updated on an annual basis.

A Maryland Inventory form provides a description of historic resource and discusses its history, but the MIHP is not a regulatory instrument, and the determination of a resource’s historic significance is not a requirement for inclusion.

vucr-2imw,Washington_County_2022_GeologicFormations,"This layer contains data concerning the location and characteristics of bedrock, mappable geologic units, within Washington county. This geodatabase contains geologic data from Washington County, Maryland. Data from several geologic quadrangles and two regional scale geologic maps were incorporated into the regional scale geologic feature classes in this geodatabase. Because of the scale of this map, some features were generalized slightly from the quad scale data. Additionally, some corrections were made for accuracy, such as edge matching to resolve ""border faults"". The source data for this map and geodatabase come from maps published by the Maryland Geological Survey from 2001 to the present, as well as one map published in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey. The source maps are Buckeystown (2001), Catoctin Furnace (2004), Frederick (2004), New Windsor (2004), Point of Rocks (2004), Walkersville (2004), Woodsboro (2004), Middletown (2005), Union Bridge (2006), Funkstown (2009), Keedysville, Shepherdstown, Charlestown, and Harpers Ferry (2009), Myersville and Smithsburg (2009), Hagerstown (2013), Mason and Dixon (2013), Clear Spring and Hedgesville (2014), Williamsport (2014), Blue Ridge Summit (2021, in review), Emmitsburg and Taneytown (2021, in review), all 1:24000 quadrangle scale, as well as portions of two regional maps: Geologic Map of Garrett, Allegany, and Western Washington Counties, Maryland (2013), and Geologic Map of the Frederick 30' x 60' Quadrangle, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia (USGS, 2007). The GIS data from the referenced maps were mosaiced in Arc Map, corrected for accuracy across quad boundaries, merged to form a continuous dataset and clipped to the extent of Washington County. Feature level metadata are included, which contain field descriptions for each feature class. This is a small scale dataset, appropriate for 1:100,000 regional scale.

Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays.

9a2c-e4f7,Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Points,"MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Points data consists of point geometric features which represent traffic count locations along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Traffic counts are performed in order to calculate the annual average daily traffic (AADT), annual average weekday traffic (AAWDT), and AADT based on vehicle class (current year only) for locations along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Overall percent utilization, percent utilization based on vehicle class, and truck-specific percent utilization are showcased as statistical metrics for each location where applicable. Ten years of historic AADT and AAWDT traffic count information is also available for each location where applicable.

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), located throughout Maryland. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous ATRs and short-term traffic counts. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA). A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where “0” represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), “1” represents the count taken in 2013, “2” represents the count taken in 2012, “3” represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is a strategic resource for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), as well as many other State and local government agencies. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of State highway improvement and safety programs. The MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet MDOT SHA’s long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year.   This data is for the year 2019.

The purpose of this data is to identify through, local, and restricted truck routes within Baltimore City. These routes specify where large trucks are allowed to drive, for the use by truck operators, trucking companies, and City transportation offices. The linear geometric features of this dataset were created by merging the National Highway Freight Network (NHFN) (https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/infrastructure/nfn/index.htm) with Baltimore City's Freight Network (data provided by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation). A “NHFN_ID” field is provided to distinguish City freight routes that are also a part of the NHFN. Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) values from 2017 are provided for each line segment where applicable. AADT values and percent utilization are provided for each vehicle classification (Motorcycle, Car, Light Truck, Single Unit Truck and Combination Unit Truck). A “Freight AADT” field and a “Freight Percent Utilization” field are also provided. Freight AADT was calculated by summing Single Unit Truck (FHWA Class 5 to 7) and Combination Unit Truck (FHWA Class 8 to 13) AADT values. Freight Percent Utilization was calculated by dividing the Freight AADT by the total AADT. Light Trucks (FHWA Class 3) were intentionally excluded from the Freight AADT and Freight Percent Utilization as these vehicles are not restricted to traversing on the City’s freight network. AADT data was obtained from the “Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Lines” layer on MD iMAP (https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Transportation/MD_AnnualAverageDailyTraffic/FeatureServer/1).

22zu-5iwr,For Hire Party Cruises,"Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland’s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters.

di62-49cu,Physiographic Provinces,"This data layer contains the Province-level physiographic subdivisions of Maryland in ArcGIS format. The file was developed from components of a detailed digital physiographic map of Maryland by James P. Reger and Emery T. Cleaves, currently in progress. 

Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it.  The approach for the detailed physiographic map of Maryland is hierarchical and descriptive.  Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure, rock type, geomorphic history, and topographic characteristics.  Data and subdivisions were compiled at a 1:100,000 scale for the detailed state-wide map. The hierarchical classification of the detailed physiographic map (in progress) includes subdivisions as follows, in descending order (and generally decreasing size): Province, Section, Region, District, Area.  In Maryland there are portions of five physiographic Provinces. 

In this file, the polygons reflect Province level subdivision. The polygon feature attribute table has been developed to pertain only to the Provinces level.

3xda-h6fq,US Routes,"Maryland Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for all public roadways in the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerlines data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway related data products. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Maryland Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

The origin of the underlying data is a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service aerial survey conducted between December, 2001 and March, 2003. The source data were collected on-transect (120m width, 60 m each side) for transects conducted in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, in Delaware Bay, and in offshore waters from the beach outward. Aerial surveys of waterbirds were flown to at least 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore from northern New Jersey to the Virginia / North Carolina border. All waterbird species in the USFWS database from winter surveys only were exported to density blocks. Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects.

A “Freight AADT” field and a “Freight Percent Utilization” field are also provided. Freight AADT was calculated by summing Single Unit Truck (FHWA Class 5 to 7) and Combination Unit Truck (FHWA Class 8 to 13) AADT values. Freight Percent Utilization was calculated by dividing the Freight AADT by the total AADT. Light Trucks (FHWA Class 3) were intentionally excluded from the Freight AADT and Freight Percent Utilization as these vehicles are not restricted to traversing on the City’s freight network. AADT data was obtained from the “Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Lines” layer on MD iMAP (https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Transportation/MD_AnnualAverageDailyTraffic/FeatureServer/1).

n7j8-tir9,Zip Codes - 11 Digit,"This dataset is the Maryland ZIP codes based on the most current MD PropertyView data.  In 1993, the Maryland Department of Planning and the Maryland State Highway Administration entered into a Data Base Usage Agreement with Bell Atlantic and Data Chromatics, Inc. to develop an enhanced street address map for Maryland. Zip Code boundary area files were one of the products derived from this partnership. The resulting boundary area files were intended to improve the cartographic quality and accuracy of the zip code boundary area files derived from the U.S. Census Bureau's post 1990 Census TIGER\Line Files (based on the Census Bureau's zip code tabulation areas, ZCTAs). Subsequent iterative improvements to the Zip Code boundary area files have been made using premise address information associated with mapped parcel records as provided in the Maryland Department of Planning's MdProperty View GIS product. The resulting files are meant to serve as a ""good approximation"" of zip codes as polygons (which in reality they are not) but are not official Zip Code maps and are not meant to be a substitute for any products offered by the U.S. Postal Service, the official source for zip code information. While there are no restrictions on their use we do recommend that they are best used with MdProperty View and that MDP makes no guarantee or warranty regarding the files.

m379-9h5x,Hazard Reduction by Habitats,"Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast, including Atlantic, Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index, representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR’s Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.",J.B.

km7c-v8cs,Bottom Classification 2011 CZM Block 1,"QuesterTangent’s SWATHVIEW seabed classification software was used to post-process the 410 kHz side scan sonar signal. This software analyzes the side scan sonar backscatter signal to produce a classification map based on the acoustical reflectivity characteristics of bottom sediments. Employing proprietary algorithms SWATHVIEW uses multivariate analysis to find patterns in the side scan acoustic backscatter signal which reflect bottom textural parameters. Cluster analysis is used to group together regions of similar acoustic backscatter characteristics, or classes. Once the acoustic classes were determined, they were correlated with bottom samples and imagery. Bottom grab samples were obtained using a Van Veen sampler with a 4-inch depth capacity. Sampling sites were chosen based on the side scan data. We took samples on acoustically distinct bottom types to confirm our estimates of those types. The seabed classification data were layered over the side scan mosaics and bathymetry. These data sets were used to correlate side scan reflectivity with acoustic seabed classes and detect any influences that abrupt changes in seafloor slope may have on the acoustic data. Steep slopes tend to scatter the acoustic signals and produce anomalous data. REFS: Conkwright, R.D., Van Ryswick, S, Sylvia, E.R. 2014. Seafloor Survey of Nearshore Ocean City Maryland.

Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).  

A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (“3‑C”) planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions. 

The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Maryland's MPOs are as follows: National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB), Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB), Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO), Hagerstown/Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO), Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO), Salisbury/Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S/WMPO), and Calvert-St. Mary’s Metropolitan Planning Organization (C-SMMPO).  

Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). Being a subset of the USDOT's NTAD, an annual update of Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is performed by TSO in close coordination with each MPO, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). MPO Boundaries data is a strategic resource for the USDOT, FHWA, MDOT, as well as many other National, State, and local government agencies. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is updated on an annual basis.

c4yh-knag,Spot Weakfish Croaker Juvenile Habitat,"These datasets exist in raster and vector formats. The vector format was created from the SHA Shoreline file and graphic representations in the Lippson book (See bibliography below). These areas were then confirmed with the White book (See bibliography below) and the ""Habitat Requirements for Chesapeake Bay Living Resources"". While not a fishery in Maryland, they are a prey species for larger fisheries in the Chesapeake. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.

jjcu-mmde,Rates of Change Transects,"To quantify rates of change (erosion or accretion) along coastal and estuarine shorelines in Maryland, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), installed and ran a computer program, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), using as input a series of digital shoreline vectors dating from 1841-1995. Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright, 1975), (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a “baseline” landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines, inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline, and cast straight-line transects from each node, perpendicular to the baseline, across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs, DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect. Subsequently, updates began in 2015 is updating by county the DSAS process using newer Shoreline data and refined calculations to update the Rates of Change erosion values by county. Currently Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Harford and Prince George's counties have the newest erosion rate values contained in this Data set.",J.B.

gmsy-wb3q,Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties,"The Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties is a research and documentation instrument that serves as an archive of information to further the understanding of the State’s architectural, archeological, and cultural resources. To date, the MIHP is comprised of nearly 90,000 resources, composed of archaeological sites, building, structures, objects and survey districts. A Maryland Inventory form provides a description of historic resource and discusses its history, but the MIHP is not a regulatory instrument, and the determination of a resource’s historic significance is not a requirement for inclusion. Maryland State law provides elsewhere for mechanisms – separate from the MIHP – giving both the State and local jurisdictions the authority to regulate appropriately designated historic resources. The Maryland Inventory should not be confused with the National Register of Historic Places, the Maryland Register of Historic Properties, or local lists of locally designated historic resources, although resources listed in all of the above categories are included in the Maryland Inventory.

ypiv-xcnd,Harford 30 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Harford County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Harford County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s NOAA National Shoreline data sets and the ca. 2000 NOAA CUSP shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Harford County between the years 2005-2007. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

gncs-mgck,Local and Other Roads,"Maryland Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for all public roadways in the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerlines data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway related data products. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Maryland Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

j3hk-gvdr,MD Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation Easements,"The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), housed within the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA), protects agricultural lands through the use of perpetual easements. This program was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 1977, is governed by the Agricultural Article, Sections 2-501 through 2-519 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. MALPF’s primary purpose is to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland to provide for the continuing production of food and fiber for the citizens of Maryland. This is accomplished by landowners voluntarily applying to sell an easement on their property through a competitive State-wide application process. MALPF easement boundaries are estimated based on property descriptions provided by MDA, aligned to iMap parcel polygons and supplemented with MdProperty View data to facilitate use with vectorized parcel data. This GIS dataset is intended for general guidance and use only and is not designed as a substitute for legal survey. The coordinates displayed do not represent legal parcel corners and/or boundaries and they cannot be used for establishment of or in lieu of legal land survey boundaries. New fields have been added since the previous update to facilitate the integration of this dataset with the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US). Attributes for these fields, which are identified below as PAD-US fields, are not available for all data collected historically. The Maryland Department of Planning will continue to populate these new fields as updates become available. For a full description of the contents of the PAD-US fields, see https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/pad-us-data-manual.

bq7r-auss,Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility,"Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data consists of linear geometric features which specifically show public roadways that are eligible for Federal funding in the State of Maryland. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is primarily used for general planning and funding purposes, as well as for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission & coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is key to understanding which public roadways are eligible for Federal funding in the State of Maryland. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

4g34-ywir,Frederick_County_2022_GeologicStructure,"This layer contains data concerning field measurements of inclined bedding, structure features like fracture, cleavage, and other field measurements within Frederick county. This geodatabase contains geologic data from Frederick and County, Maryland. Data from several geologic quadrangles and two regional scale geologic maps were incorporated into the regional scale geologic feature classes in this geodatabase. Because of the scale of this map, some features were generalized slightly from the quad scale data. Additionally, some corrections were made for accuracy, such as edge matching to resolve ""border faults"". The source data for this map and geodatabase come from maps published by the Maryland Geological Survey from 2001 to the present, as well as one map published in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey. The source maps are Buckeystown (2001), Catoctin Furnace (2004), Frederick (2004), New Windsor (2004), Point of Rocks (2004), Walkersville (2004), Woodsboro (2004), Middletown (2005), Union Bridge (2006), Funkstown (2009), Keedysville, Shepherdstown, Charlestown, and Harpers Ferry (2009), Myersville and Smithsburg (2009), Hagerstown (2013), Mason and Dixon (2013), Clear Spring and Hedgesville (2014), Williamsport (2014), Blue Ridge Summit (2021, in review), Emmitsburg and Taneytown (2021, in review), all 1:24000 quadrangle scale, as well as portions of two regional maps: Geologic Map of Garrett, Allegany, and Western Washington Counties, Maryland (2013), and Geologic Map of the Frederick 30' x 60' Quadrangle, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia (USGS, 2007).

9xrb-rsst,Calvert 10 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the ""DSAS_SRC"" attribute table field -- ""CAC"" indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; ""NOAA CUSP"" indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

45ge-vmi7,Bottom Classification 2002 Shoal Field 1,"USACE, Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), Minerals Management Service (MMS), and academic scientists have studied the seafloor and shoals of the Maryland offshore study area in order to determine their potential use as a source of sand for beach nourishment. Studies conducted by MGS of Fenwick, Weaver, and Isle of Wight Shoals show four general patterns of substrate conditions: 1) Shoal crest - generally is restricted to the undisturbed shoal crest at depths less than 35 it (11.2 m) and, has no discernable bedforms; Shoal crests consist of sand with almost no shell material; Coarser gravels are concentrated in areas of greatest wave and current energies, such as along the shoal crest. 2) Flank- bottom class associated With the shoal crest; primarily found along the shoal flanks between -35 ft and -40 ft, representing transitional bottom, from shoal crest to intershoal bottom type; sand, the texture of which may or may not be significantly different than that of the shoal crest; occasional ripples; sand with some shell and other biogenic materials. 3) Intershoal-associated with the deeper sea bottom (> 40 feet), both disturbed (dredged) and undisturbed intershoal areas or troughs; sandy bottom dominated by small ripples ( 40 feet) in trough or intershoal areas; large patches, ~l00 it in diameter, associated with rippled bottom within the dredged area; interpreted to be soft, finer-grained sediment based on low backscatter intensity return; Patch-mat regions occur between shoals that have muddy substrates, abundant patches/mats of worm tube colonies, and shell beds.

Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland’s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized.

dke4-46uz,MD Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation Easements,"The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), housed within the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA), protects agricultural lands through the use of perpetual easements. This program was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 1977, is governed by the Agricultural Article, Sections 2-501 through 2-519 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. MALPF’s primary purpose is to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland to provide for the continuing production of food and fiber for the citizens of Maryland. This is accomplished by landowners voluntarily applying to sell an easement on their property through a competitive State-wide application process. MALPF easement boundaries are estimated based on property descriptions provided by MDA, aligned to iMap parcel polygons and supplemented with MdProperty View data to facilitate use with vectorized parcel data. This GIS dataset is intended for general guidance and use only and is not designed as a substitute for legal survey. The coordinates displayed do not represent legal parcel corners and/or boundaries and they cannot be used for establishment of or in lieu of legal land survey boundaries. New fields have been added since the previous update to facilitate the integration of this dataset with the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US). Attributes for these fields, which are identified below as PAD-US fields, are not available for all data collected historically. The Maryland Department of Planning will continue to populate these new fields as updates become available. For a full description of the contents of the PAD-US fields, see https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/pad-us-data-manual.

Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location.

kzbu-fs2f,Shoreline Hazard Index,"Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast, including Atlantic, Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index, representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR’s Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.

ch8m-kcch,Prince Georges 10 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Prince George's County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Prince George's County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Prince George's County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County in 2007. In Prince George’s County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 60% of the shoreline in the county. MGS decided to supplement the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Anacostia River, from approximately the Bladensburg Road bridge, north to the Decatur Street bridge; Northwest Branch Anacostia River, from approximately the 38th Street bridge, south to its confluence with the Anacostia River; the lower reaches of Swanson Creek, west of Chalk Point; Spice Creek and an unnamed creek north of Spice Creek; and Patuxent River and its major tributaries, from approximately the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to the upper reaches of the Patuxent River. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the ""DSAS_SRC"" attribute table field -- ""CAC"" indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; ""NOAA CUSP"" indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

cakz-ywqr,Census Designated and Incorporated Places 2020,"The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2020 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2020 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

dgup-vixu,DNR Owned Lands and Conservation Easements,"The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manages over 446,000 acres of public lands and protected open space in the state. The DNR Lands data (part of Technology Toolbox Protected Lands data set) consists of mapped information that represent those lands that are owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Utilizing various land protection programs and funding sources, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has preserved environmentally important lands through the use of perpetual conservation easements. The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers, establish wetlands, protect highly erodible land, and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.Data from individual county and state records were used in production of DNR Lands. Specific Project boundary maps, subdivision plats and deed plots were used to create boundary polygons. In the case of the Chesapeake Forest properties, original property boundary data was received from the Chesapeake Corporation. The horizontal accuracy of these lines is being continually improved.The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.

e3uw-p7y3,Qualified Census Tracts,"The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) designates Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) for purposes of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. The LIHTC program is defined in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The LIHTC is a tax incentive intended to increase the availability of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC statute provides two criteria for QCT eligibility. A census tract must have either: 1) a poverty rate of at least 25 percent; or 2) 50 percent or more of its householders must have incomes below 60 percent of the area median household income. The area corresponds to a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan area. Further, the LIHTC statute requires that no more than 20 percent of the metropolitan area population reside within designated QCTs (This limit also applies collectively to the nonmetropolitan counties in each state). Thus, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT. With respect to the census tracts, the Census Bureau defines them in cooperation with local authorities every ten years for the purposes of the decennial census and, following a public comment period, has recently completed defining tract boundaries for the 2010 Census. Note that when census tract boundaries are set, they remain unchanged for the next decade. Thus, tract boundaries will not be changed until the 2020 Decennial Census.",J.B.

Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for Hydrologic unit boundaries define the aerial extent of surface water drainage to a point. Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the United States. This system divides the country into 21 Regions, 222 Subregions, 352 Accounting Units, and 2,149 Cataloging Units based on surface hydrologic features. The smallest USGS unit (8-digit HU) is approximately 448,000 acres. During the late 1970's the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation Service, initiated a national program to further subdivide HU's into smaller watersheds for water resources planning. A 3-digit extension was added to the 8-digit identification. By the early 1980's this 11-digit HU mapping was completed for most of the U.S. These data demonstrate Maryland's watersheds as represented by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code denoted by an 11-digit numerical code. The watersheds were defined using contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. The state has been divided into 138 watersheds that are identified by Maryland, using an 8-digit numerical code. These watersheds are equivalent to the HUC 11-digit codes. The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24,000. A new 12-digit watershed file is available from DNR which provides more detailed line work for over 1,100 watersheds which is approximately equivalent to the HUC 14-digit code.",J.B.

sjbi-4adi,Interstates,"Maryland Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for all public roadways in the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerlines data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway related data products. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Maryland Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

nm6f-agu6,Bottom Classification 2012 CZM Block 2,"QuesterTangent’s SWATHVIEW seabed classification software to post-process the 410 kHz side scan sonar signal. This software analyzes the side scan sonar backscatter signal to produce a classification map based on the acoustical reflectivity characteristics of bottom sediments. Employing proprietary algorithms SWATHVIEW uses multivariate analysis to find patterns in the side scan acoustic backscatter signal which reflect bottom textural parameters. Cluster analysis is used to group together regions of similar acoustic backscatter characteristics, or classes. Once the acoustic classes were determined, they were correlated with bottom samples and imagery. Bottom grab samples were obtained using a Van Veen sampler with a 4-inch depth capacity. Sampling sites were chosen based on the side scan data. We took samples on acoustically distinct bottom types to confirm our estimates of those types. The seabed classification data were layered over the side scan mosaics and bathymetry. These data sets were used to correlate side scan reflectivity with acoustic seabed classes and detect any influences that abrupt changes in seafloor slope may have on the acoustic data. Steep slopes tend to scatter the acoustic signals and produce anomalous data. REFS: Conkwright, R.D., Van Ryswick, S, Sylvia, E.R. 2014. Seafloor Survey of Nearshore Ocean City Maryland.

ixvh-ay8y,Roadway Functional Classification,"Roadway Functional Classification consists of linear features which specifically show the functional classification of public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission & coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry. Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs. Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety. Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). This data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Functional Classification data is key to understanding the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout Maryland's network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

8ccz-b8qi,Transfer Development Rights and Purchase Development Rights,"Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) are two tools used to protect lands from development. ""Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) is a voluntary, incentive-based program that allows landowners to sell development rights from their land to a developer or other interested party who then can use these rights to increase the density of development at another designated location. While the seller of development rights still owns the land and can continue using it, an easement is placed on the property that prevents further development. A TDR program protects land resources at the same time providing additional income to both the landowner and the holder of the development rights."" Source: https://www.uwsp.edu/cnr-ap/clue/Documents/PlanImplementation/Transfer_of_Development_Rights.pdf The Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) is a voluntary program in which a land trust or a local, county or state agency buys the development rights on a parcel of land, primarily agricultural. PDRs ""permanently extinguish all preexisting development potential of a particular property and are not used to offset development elsewhere in the county. Other than very limited rights reserved to the original grantor and their immediate family, no further commercial or residential subdivision is allowed.

sqej-hvk5,Road Centerlines Comprehensive,"Maryland Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for all public roadways in the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerlines data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway related data products.Maryland Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Maryland Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

Borrow Area 2 has been virtually exhausted by dredging.

Revised volumentric estimations for Shoals B, C, D, Little Gull Bank & Great Gull Bank (1996) ""In the 1993 sand resources study (Conkwright and Gast, 1994b) the seismically defined ravinement surface was used as the lower structural boundary for volume calculations. However, the purpose of the current study is to estimate only the volume of sand with measured physical parameters. Therefore, the lower boundary for volumetric calculations was determined primarily by the grain size parameters of vibracore samples. The lower boundary surface was set at the depth where the sampled sand became too fine or too poorly sorted for use as beach fill. In those cases where the entire length of core contained usable sand, the boundary surface was set at the depth of maximum vibracore penetration. Because vibracore penetrations on Little and Great Gull Banks were generally within a meter of the ravinement surface, that surface was used as the lower boundary for those shoals, unless vibracore samples indicated otherwise.""

44an-zbc4,Maryland Routes,"Maryland Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for all public roadways in the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerlines data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway related data products. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Maryland Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Maryland Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

bww7-2rvj,Bottom Classification 2011 CZM Block 1,"QuesterTangent’s SWATHVIEW seabed classification software was used to post-process the 410 kHz side scan sonar signal. This software analyzes the side scan sonar backscatter signal to produce a classification map based on the acoustical reflectivity characteristics of bottom sediments. Employing proprietary algorithms SWATHVIEW uses multivariate analysis to find patterns in the side scan acoustic backscatter signal which reflect bottom textural parameters. Cluster analysis is used to group together regions of similar acoustic backscatter characteristics, or classes. Once the acoustic classes were determined, they were correlated with bottom samples and imagery. Bottom grab samples were obtained using a Van Veen sampler with a 4-inch depth capacity. Sampling sites were chosen based on the side scan data. We took samples on acoustically distinct bottom types to confirm our estimates of those types. The seabed classification data were layered over the side scan mosaics and bathymetry. These data sets were used to correlate side scan reflectivity with acoustic seabed classes and detect any influences that abrupt changes in seafloor slope may have on the acoustic data. Steep slopes tend to scatter the acoustic signals and produce anomalous data. REFS: Conkwright, R.D., Van Ryswick, S, Sylvia, E.R. 2014. Seafloor Survey of Nearshore Ocean City Maryland.

Alexander and others (1999) developed ERF1, which assessed the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and calculated the mean water time-of-travel in river reaches and reservoirs. ERF1-2 serves as the foundation for SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions (of nutrient transport) On Watershed) modeling. Within the context of a Geographic Information System, SPARROW estimates the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous U.S. with outflow concentrations of several nutrients, including total nitrogen and total phosphorus, (Smith, R.A., Schwarz, G.E., and Alexander, R.B., 1997). This version of the network expands on ERF1 (version 1.2; Alexander et al. 1999), and includes the incremental and total drainage area derived from 1-kilometer (km) elevation data for North America. Previous estimates of the water time-of-travel were recomputed for reaches with water- quality monitoring sites that included two reaches. The mean flow and velocity estimates for these split reaches are based on previous estimation methods (Alexander et al., 1999) and are unchanged in ERF1-2. Drainage area calculations provide data used to estimate the contribution of a given nutrient to the outflow. Data estimates depend on the accuracy of node connectivity. Reaches split at water- quality or pesticide-monitoring sites indicate the source point for estimating the contribution and transport of nutrients and their loads throughout the watersheds. The ERF1-2 coverage extends the earlier ERF1 coverage by providing digital-elevation-model (DEM-based estimates of reach drainage area founded on the 1-kilometer data for North America (Verdin, 1996; Verdin and Jenson, 1996).

evgx-u6vy,Marsh Protection Potential Index,"The Marsh Protection Potential Index (MPPI) ranks Maryland’s coastal marshes by their ability to protect vulnerable communities from coastal hazards. To do so, we identified five key questions to assess each marsh: How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards? Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat? Is the marsh located where there are people to protect? Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats? Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels? Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources, we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then, the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating, which ranks the protective ability of over 14,000 marshes statewide. It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes, rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh, nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition, the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity, ecosystem health, rare species, recreation value, or water quality services are often important to stakeholders, and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement, not replace, the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats.",J.B.

egwu-3sbv,Tide Gauge Locations,"This data layer shows the locations of NOAA tide gauges in Maryland. Knowledge of the timing and strength of tidal currents is extremely important for safe navigation in coastal waters. Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data, the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors, real-time current measurements are preferred.

g57d-4v7j,Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Lines,"MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Lines data consists of linear geometric features which represent traffic count sections along public roadways in the State of Maryland.  Traffic counts are performed in order to calculate the annual average daily traffic (AADT), annual average weekday traffic (AAWDT), and AADT based on vehicle class (current year only) for sections along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Overall percent utilization, percent utilization based on vehicle class, and truck-specific percent utilization are showcased as statistical metrics for each road section where applicable. Ten years of historic AADT and AAWDT traffic count information is also available for each road section where applicable. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), located throughout Maryland. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous ATRs, and short-term traffic counts. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA). A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where “0” represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), “1” represents the count taken in 2013, “2” represents the count taken in 2012, “3” represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is a strategic resource for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), as well as many other State and local government agencies. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of State highway improvement and safety programs. The MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet MDOT SHA’s long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2019.

qu2r-h2f9,Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Points,"MDOT SHA Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Points data consists of point geometric features which represent traffic count locations along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Traffic counts are performed in order to calculate the annual average daily traffic (AADT), annual average weekday traffic (AAWDT), and AADT based on vehicle class (current year only) for locations along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Overall percent utilization, percent utilization based on vehicle class, and truck-specific percent utilization are showcased as statistical metrics for each location where applicable. Ten years of historic AADT and AAWDT traffic count information is also available for each location where applicable.

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), located throughout Maryland. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous ATRs and short-term traffic counts. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA). A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where “0” represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), “1” represents the count taken in 2013, “2” represents the count taken in 2012, “3” represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is a strategic resource for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), as well as many other State and local government agencies. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of State highway improvement and safety programs. The MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet MDOT SHA’s long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. 

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year.   This data is for the year 2019.

ja4m-y5tc,Priority Shoreline Areas,"Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast, including Atlantic, Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index, representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR’s Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities. This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS).

99nu-4tb6,Anne Arundel 30 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1971-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Anne Arundel County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Anne Arundel County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Anne Arundel County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County in 2007. In Anne Arundel County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered all shoreline in the county with the exception of the Patuxent River along the western county border. As such, MGS utilized the CAC shoreline data set in the Patuxent River area. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the ""DSAS_SRC"" attribute table field -- ""CAC"" indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; ""NOAA CUSP"" indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set.

w2ev-sacx,Very High Risk Census Tracts,"Each of the State of Maryland’s 1,406 2010 census tracts was analyzed to determine whether it represented a typical census tract as defined by the U. S. Bureau of the Census. Nationally these are census tracts that optimally are 4,000 inhabitants but generally range from 1,200 to 8,000 persons. In Maryland the average census tract contains 4,106 persons. Nationally the housing unit threshold for each census tract generally ranges from 480 to 3,200 housing units, with an optimum size of 1,600 housing units. In Maryland the average census tract contains 1,692 housing units. The Emergency Management Planning Database and the Emergency Planning Vulnerable Population Index are intended to assist State agency emergency officials plan tactics, develop strategies, allocate resources and prioritize responses for emergencies and to identify potentially vulnerable population areas for special attention. Statewide, there are 222 census tracts containing persons at “Very High” socio – economic risk or vulnerability in the event of an emergency. “Very High” risk census tracts account for 16 – percent of the State’s 1,390 specified census tracts. These census tracts are located throughout the State in 20 of 24 jurisdictions.

This application is based on their Marine Mammal and Seabird Computer Database Analysis System (MMS-CDAS). The origin of the underlying data is a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service aerial survey conducted between December, 2001 and March, 2003. The source data were collected on-transect (120m width, 60 m each side) for transects conducted in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, in Delaware Bay, and in offshore waters from the beach outward. Aerial surveys of waterbirds were flown to at least 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore from northern New Jersey to the Virginia / North Carolina border. All waterbird species in the USFWS database from winter surveys only were exported to density blocks. Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects. The spatial extent of the database (and thus of this data set) is from the Virginia/North Carolina border to the Hudson Canyon (including Delaware Bay and the lowest part of Chesapeake Bay).",J.B.

fznb-igfd,Qualified Census Tracts,"The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) designates Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) for purposes of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. The LIHTC program is defined in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The LIHTC is a tax incentive intended to increase the availability of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC statute provides two criteria for QCT eligibility. A census tract must have either: 1) a poverty rate of at least 25 percent; or 2) 50 percent or more of its householders must have incomes below 60 percent of the area median household income. The area corresponds to a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan area. Further, the LIHTC statute requires that no more than 20 percent of the metropolitan area population reside within designated QCTs (This limit also applies collectively to the nonmetropolitan counties in each state). Thus, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT. With respect to the census tracts, the Census Bureau defines them in cooperation with local authorities every ten years for the purposes of the decennial census and, following a public comment period, has recently completed defining tract boundaries for the 2010 Census. Note that when census tract boundaries are set, they remain unchanged for the next decade. Thus, tract boundaries will not be changed until the 2020 Decennial Census.",J.B.

vvis-cify,Zip Codes - 5 Digit,"This dataset is the Maryland ZIP codes based on the most current MD PropertyView data.  In 1993, the Maryland Department of Planning and the Maryland State Highway Administration entered into a Data Base Usage Agreement with Bell Atlantic and Data Chromatics, Inc. to develop an enhanced street address map for Maryland. Zip Code boundary area files were one of the products derived from this partnership. The resulting boundary area files were intended to improve the cartographic quality and accuracy of the zip code boundary area files derived from the U.S. Census Bureau's post 1990 Census TIGER\Line Files (based on the Census Bureau's zip code tabulation areas, ZCTAs). Subsequent iterative improvements to the Zip Code boundary area files have been made using premise address information associated with mapped parcel records as provided in the Maryland Department of Planning's MdProperty View GIS product. The resulting files are meant to serve as a ""good approximation"" of zip codes as polygons (which in reality they are not) but are not official Zip Code maps and are not meant to be a substitute for any products offered by the U.S. Postal Service, the official source for zip code information.

u9ym-dks6,Critical Areas Counties,"In 1984, the General Assembly enacted the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Act to regulate development, manage land use and conserve natural resources on land in those areas designated as Critical Area. For this document, the Critical Area is all land and water areas within 1,000 feet of the tidal waters' edge or from the landward edge of adjacent tidal wetlands and the lands under them. Georeferenced digital data files of the critical Area have been produced for Baltimore City and the 16 Maryland counties with land located within the Critical Area. The digital maps produced for each jurisdiction are polygons depicting the Critical Area and the land use classifications recognized by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CBCAC). Each jurisdiction is a separate file. The data were produced from hard copy parcel maps originally submitted by the counties as part of the requirements for developing their Critical Area Program. For the purpose of the Mdimap web service the Critical Area Data is displayed by two data layers, one general layer and one layer showing the available critical area data for local towns.This data set represents the Department of Natural Resources interpretation of the location and extent of the Critical Area; however, the digital maps are not recognized as the ""official"" maps. In accordance with Subsection 8-1807(a) of the Critical Area Act, the Critical Area consists of (1) All waters and lands under the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries to the head of tide as indicated on the State wetland maps, and all State and private wetlands designated under Environment Article, Title 16, annotated Code of Maryland; (2) All land and water areas within 1,000 feet beyond the landward boundaries of State or private wetlands and the of tides designated under Environment Article, Article 16, Annotated Code of Maryland; and (3) Modification to these areas through inclusions or exclusions proposed by local jurisdictions and approved by Commission as specified in Natural Resources Article, Subsection 8-1807, annotated Code of Maryland. These maps are hard copy maps that cannot be exactly replicated in a digital format; therefore, some interpretation was necessary to create the digital line. Hard copy maps depicting the official Critical Area boundary line are available for review at the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission, and at most local planning and zoning departments. The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use. The intended use is for general information and planning purposes. It is not intended to be used to determine the exact location of the Critical Area boundary on a specific parcel or to determine the acreage within the Critical Area on a specific site.

mcv5-7aqu,Chesapeake Bay Terrapin Habitat,"These data sets exist in raster and vector formats. The areas in this data set were determined from USGS Terrapin studies (for more information contact Paula Henry, 410-465-0550 or paula.henry@usgs.gov), DNR studies conducted by Margaret Whilden, and a terrapin study conducted by Willem Roosenburg (contact information can be acquired from Harley Speir of DNR Fisheries Service). For extent acquracies please contact the project lead for each study. Secondary habitats were delineated using sandy beach data from VIMS and salinity data from Lee Karrh of DNR. Sandy beach areas were selected and exported from the source file and then combined with the salinity data to determine sensitivity importance levels. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.",J.B.

ct68-t8ca,Zip Codes - 11 Digit,"This dataset is the Maryland ZIP codes based on the most current MD PropertyView data.  In 1993, the Maryland Department of Planning and the Maryland State Highway Administration entered into a Data Base Usage Agreement with Bell Atlantic and Data Chromatics, Inc. to develop an enhanced street address map for Maryland. Zip Code boundary area files were one of the products derived from this partnership. The resulting boundary area files were intended to improve the cartographic quality and accuracy of the zip code boundary area files derived from the U.S. Census Bureau's post 1990 Census TIGER\Line Files (based on the Census Bureau's zip code tabulation areas, ZCTAs). Subsequent iterative improvements to the Zip Code boundary area files have been made using premise address information associated with mapped parcel records as provided in the Maryland Department of Planning's MdProperty View GIS product. The resulting files are meant to serve as a ""good approximation"" of zip codes as polygons (which in reality they are not) but are not official Zip Code maps and are not meant to be a substitute for any products offered by the U.S. Postal Service, the official source for zip code information. While there are no restrictions on their use we do recommend that they are best used with MdProperty View and that MDP makes no guarantee or warranty regarding the files.

gh7q-wfft,Tide Gauge Locations,"This data layer shows the locations of NOAA tide gauges in Maryland. Knowledge of the timing and strength of tidal currents is extremely important for safe navigation in coastal waters. Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data, the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors, real-time current measurements are preferred.

9np9-bqcz,Shoreline Hazard Index,"Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast, including Atlantic, Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index, representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR’s Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities. This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS).

mmr4-z4ra,Anne Arundel 10 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Anne Arundel County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Anne Arundel County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Anne Arundel County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County in 2007. In Anne Arundel County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered all shoreline in the county with the exception of the Patuxent River along the western county border. As such, MGS utilized the CAC shoreline data set in the Patuxent River area. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the ""DSAS_SRC"" attribute table field -- ""CAC"" indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; ""NOAA CUSP"" indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions, they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition, they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location, mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower, LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data.

xh2j-f6hp,Prince Georges 30 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Prince George's County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Prince George's County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Prince George's County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County in 2007. In Prince George’s County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 60% of the shoreline in the county. MGS decided to supplement the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Anacostia River, from approximately the Bladensburg Road bridge, north to the Decatur Street bridge; Northwest Branch Anacostia River, from approximately the 38th Street bridge, south to its confluence with the Anacostia River; the lower reaches of Swanson Creek, west of Chalk Point; Spice Creek and an unnamed creek north of Spice Creek; and Patuxent River and its major tributaries, from approximately the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to the upper reaches of the Patuxent River. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the ""DSAS_SRC"" attribute table field -- ""CAC"" indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; ""NOAA CUSP"" indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

Between 1988-1992, ~2.9 million m^3 was dredged from Borrow Area 2, ~4.2 million m^3 dredged from Borrow Area 3, and ~3.2 million m^3 dredged from Borrow Area 9 (Wells, 1994). Revised volumentric estimations for Shoals B, C, D, Little Gull Bank & Great Gull Bank (1996) ""In the 1993 sand resources study (Conkwright and Gast, 1994b) the seismically defined ravinement surface was used as the lower structural boundary for volume calculations. However, the purpose of the current study is to estimate only the volume of sand with measured physical parameters. Therefore, the lower boundary for volumetric calculations was determined primarily by the grain size parameters of vibracore samples. The lower boundary surface was set at the depth where the sampled sand became too fine or too poorly sorted for use as beach fill. In those cases where the entire length of core contained usable sand, the boundary surface was set at the depth of maximum vibracore penetration. Because vibracore penetrations on Little and Great Gull Banks were generally within a meter of the ravinement surface, that surface was used as the lower boundary for those shoals, unless vibracore samples indicated otherwise.""

aeck-53h4,Harford 10 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1994-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Harford County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Harford County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s MGS shoreline and the ca. 2000 NOAA CUSP shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Harford County between the years 2005-2007. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

85cu-s49m,Census Blocks 2020,"Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2020 Census blocks nest within every other 2020 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.",J.B.

With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays.

In Maryland the average census tract contains 4,106 persons. Nationally the housing unit threshold for each census tract generally ranges from 480 to 3,200 housing units, with an optimum size of 1,600 housing units. In Maryland the average census tract contains 1,692 housing units. The Emergency Management Planning Database and the Emergency Planning Vulnerable Population Index are intended to assist State agency emergency officials plan tactics, develop strategies, allocate resources and prioritize responses for emergencies and to identify potentially vulnerable population areas for special attention. Statewide, there are 222 census tracts containing persons at “Very High” socio – economic risk or vulnerability in the event of an emergency. “Very High” risk census tracts account for 16 – percent of the State’s 1,390 specified census tracts. These census tracts are located throughout the State in 20 of 24 jurisdictions. There are 773,808 persons living in these areas making up 13.4 percent of the State’s 2010 Census population of 5,773,552 persons.",J.B.

5dkb-uymf,Roadway Maintenance Responsibility,"Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data consists of linear geometric features which specifically show the government agencies responsible for maintain roadways throughout the State of Maryland. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is primarily used for general planning and road maintenance coordination purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission & coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the ing publicinventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is key to understanding which government agenices are responsible for maintaining public roadways throughout the State of Maryland. Roadway Maintenance Responsibility data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

4tc9-zwjq,Census Designated and Incorporated Places 2020,"The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2020 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2020 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

With this humble beginning, the Chesapeake Bay states set a goal to reopen a total of 1,357 miles of historical spawning grounds by the year 2003. Maryland's portion of this goal is to reopen 388.65 miles of stream. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Fish Passage Program has taken this commitment very seriously; to date the Program has completed 61 projects, reopening a total 348.9 miles of upstream spawning habitat. Several projects scheduled to be completed by 2003 will allow the Program to not only meet but also exceed the goal set forth by the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Meeting this goal has been a cooperative effort between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, State Highway Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service - National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, Department of Interior - US Fish & Wildlife, Environmental Protection Agency, Chesapeake Bay Program, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, University Maryland and a multitude of others including private citizens, local watershed groups and local governments.",J.B.

t2bd-gjps,Critical Areas Counties,"In 1984, the General Assembly enacted the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Act to regulate development, manage land use and conserve natural resources on land in those areas designated as Critical Area. For this document, the Critical Area is all land and water areas within 1,000 feet of the tidal waters' edge or from the landward edge of adjacent tidal wetlands and the lands under them. Georeferenced digital data files of the critical Area have been produced for Baltimore City and the 16 Maryland counties with land located within the Critical Area. The digital maps produced for each jurisdiction are polygons depicting the Critical Area and the land use classifications recognized by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CBCAC). Each jurisdiction is a separate file. The data were produced from hard copy parcel maps originally submitted by the counties as part of the requirements for developing their Critical Area Program. For the purpose of the Mdimap web service the Critical Area Data is displayed by two data layers, one general layer and one layer showing the available critical area data for local towns.This data set represents the Department of Natural Resources interpretation of the location and extent of the Critical Area; however, the digital maps are not recognized as the ""official"" maps. In accordance with Subsection 8-1807(a) of the Critical Area Act, the Critical Area consists of (1) All waters and lands under the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries to the head of tide as indicated on the State wetland maps, and all State and private wetlands designated under Environment Article, Title 16, annotated Code of Maryland; (2) All land and water areas within 1,000 feet beyond the landward boundaries of State or private wetlands and the of tides designated under Environment Article, Article 16, Annotated Code of Maryland; and (3) Modification to these areas through inclusions or exclusions proposed by local jurisdictions and approved by Commission as specified in Natural Resources Article, Subsection 8-1807, annotated Code of Maryland. These maps are hard copy maps that cannot be exactly replicated in a digital format; therefore, some interpretation was necessary to create the digital line. Hard copy maps depicting the official Critical Area boundary line are available for review at the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission, and at most local planning and zoning departments. The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.

This geodatabase contains geologic data from Washington County, Maryland. Data from several geologic quadrangles and two regional scale geologic maps were incorporated into the regional scale geologic feature classes in this geodatabase. Because of the scale of this map, some features were generalized slightly from the quad scale data. Additionally, some corrections were made for accuracy, such as edge matching to resolve ""border faults"". The source data for this map and geodatabase come from maps published by the Maryland Geological Survey from 2001 to the present, as well as one map published in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey. The source maps are Buckeystown (2001), Catoctin Furnace (2004), Frederick (2004), New Windsor (2004), Point of Rocks (2004), Walkersville (2004), Woodsboro (2004), Middletown (2005), Union Bridge (2006), Funkstown (2009), Keedysville, Shepherdstown, Charlestown, and Harpers Ferry (2009), Myersville and Smithsburg (2009), Hagerstown (2013), Mason and Dixon (2013), Clear Spring and Hedgesville (2014), Williamsport (2014), Blue Ridge Summit (2021, in review), Emmitsburg and Taneytown (2021, in review), all 1:24000 quadrangle scale, as well as portions of two regional maps: Geologic Map of Garrett, Allegany, and Western Washington Counties, Maryland (2013), and Geologic Map of the Frederick 30' x 60' Quadrangle, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia (USGS, 2007).

eq2e-gh92,Chesapeake Bay Contours,"Bathymetry for Chesapeake Bay was derived from two hundred ninety-seven surveys containing 3,178,509 soundings. Thirty-five older, less accurate, overlapping surveys were entirely omitted before tinning. Partial overlap from other older, less accurate surveys was also omitted prior to tinning. The surveys used dated from 1859 to 1993. Thirty-six surveys dated from 1859 to 1918, thirty-seven from the 1930s, ninety-one from the 1940s, sixty- six from the 1950s, twenty-five from the 1960s, twenty-four from the 1970s, fourteen from the 1980s, and four from the 1990s. The total range of sounding data was 3.7 meters to -50.4 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0.2 and 1.2 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7.5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete.This layer was modified from its original form. Please see lineage section for details.Not to be used for Navigation. Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Nation Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together. Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point. When using the data within a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being read as floating point and not integer data.",J.B.

e6bh-6nm2,Roadway Administrative Classification,"Roadway Administrative Classification (State Classifications) data consists of linear geometric features which specifically show State highways included in the State Primary and State Secondary systems throughout Maryland. Roadway Administrative Classification is primarily used for general planning and funding purposes by showcasing the State Primary vs. State Secondary systems. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Administrative Classification is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry. Roadway Administrative Classification data is developed and maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Administrative Classification data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Administrative Classification data is key to understanding which State highways are included in the State Primary and State Secondary systems throughout Maryland. Roadway Administrative Classification data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.

ju53-sxh4,Calvert 40 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1960-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1960s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 40-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the ""DSAS_SRC"" attribute table field -- ""CAC"" indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; ""NOAA CUSP"" indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.",J.B.

This software analyzes the side scan sonar backscatter signal to produce a classification map based on the acoustical reflectivity characteristics of bottom sediments. Employing proprietary algorithms SWATHVIEW uses multivariate analysis to find patterns in the side scan acoustic backscatter signal which reflect bottom textural parameters. Cluster analysis is used to group together regions of similar acoustic backscatter characteristics, or classes. Once the acoustic classes were determined, they were correlated with bottom samples and imagery. Bottom grab samples were obtained using a Van Veen sampler with a 4-inch depth capacity. Sampling sites were chosen based on the side scan data. We took samples on acoustically distinct bottom types to confirm our estimates of those types. The seabed classification data were layered over the side scan mosaics and bathymetry. These data sets were used to correlate side scan reflectivity with acoustic seabed classes and detect any influences that abrupt changes in seafloor slope may have on the acoustic data. Steep slopes tend to scatter the acoustic signals and produce anomalous data. REFS: Conkwright, R.D., Van Ryswick, S, Sylvia, E.R. 2014. Seafloor Survey of Nearshore Ocean City Maryland.

fah7-yk94,Baltimore 10 years Shoreline Erosion Level,"To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1994-2011 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Baltimore County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Baltimore County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion.

74ji-bkhh,Targeted Ecological Areas,"Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) are lands and watersheds of high ecological value that have been identified as conservation priorities by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for natural resource protection. These areas represent the most ecologically valuable areas in the State: they are the ""best of the best"". TEAs are preferred for conservation funding through Stateside Program Open Space. This version updates the 2008 TEA layer. The first step in updating TEAs was to create an ecological baseline composed of several ecological databases which included updates of original databases and additional databases developed since 2008. The first component is the updated Green Infrastructure Assessment (circa 2010) which identifies large, contiguous blocks (hubs) of significant forests and wetlands and their connecting corridors. The Green Infrastructure’s hub and corridor network of habitat allows plant and animal migration, reduces forest fragmentation if protected, and provides important ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, cleaning air and water, storing nutrients, and protecting areas against storm and flood damage. The rare species and wildlife habitat component identifies areas that support Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species, rare plant and animal communities, species of Greatest Conservation Need, and wildlife concentrations. The aquatic life hotspots component identifies watersheds supporting freshwater stream ecosystems where conservation is needed to protect and restore areas of high aquatic biodiversity, Tier II regulated streams, and brook trout streams. The water quality protection component identifies sensitive lands such as forests, wetlands, and steep slopes where preservation is important for water quality. The coastal ecosystems component identifies Blue Infrastructure shoreline and watershed protection priorities. These are areas important for sustaining coastal and tidal ecosystems and also identifies land areas important for sustaining spawning and nursery areas for important commercial and recreational fisheries. The climate change adaptation component identifies areas important for sustaining wetlands ecosystems that are changing and moving landward in response to sea level rise. From the ecological baseline, areas that ranked as most important for each of the components were merged to create the Targeted Ecological Areas. Lands that were developed, as identified by the Maryland Department of Planning (2010) were removed from the TEA layer since developed lands are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding. Additionally, lands that are in the 0 foot to 2 foot inundation zone based on the 2011 SLAMM (Maryland Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model) study performed for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City since these areas are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding.",J.B.

s9r4-qmjg,Roadway Access Control,"Roadway Access Control data consists of linear geometric features which showcase the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Access Control data is commonly classified by three (3) control types, which are Full Access Control, Partial Access Control, and No Access Control. Roadway Access Control data is primarily used for general planning purposes, investment requirements modeling to calculate capacity and estimate type of design, in truck size and weight studies, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission & coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Access Control data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry. Roadway Access Control data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Access Control data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies.

3mw8-im9p,Marsh Protection Potential Index,"The Marsh Protection Potential Index (MPPI) ranks Maryland’s coastal marshes by their ability to protect vulnerable communities from coastal hazards. To do so, we identified five key questions to assess each marsh: How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards? Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat? Is the marsh located where there are people to protect? Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats? Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels? Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources, we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then, the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating, which ranks the protective ability of over 14,000 marshes statewide. It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes, rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh, nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition, the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity, ecosystem health, rare species, recreation value, or water quality services are often important to stakeholders, and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement, not replace, the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats.",J.B.

Utilizing various land protection programs and funding sources, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has preserved environmentally important lands through the use of perpetual conservation easements. The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers, establish wetlands, protect highly erodible land, and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.Data from individual county and state records were used in production of DNR Lands.

Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the United States. This system divides the country into 21 Regions, 222 Subregions, 352 Accounting Units, and 2,149 Cataloging Units based on surface hydrologic features. The smallest USGS unit (8-digit HU) is approximately 448,000 acres. During the late 1970's the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation Service, initiated a national program to further subdivide HU's into smaller watersheds for water resources planning. A 3-digit extension was added to the 8-digit identification. By the early 1980's this 11-digit HU mapping was completed for most of the U.S. These data demonstrate Maryland's watersheds as represented by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code denoted by an 11-digit numerical code. The watersheds were defined using contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. The state has been divided into 138 watersheds that are identified by Maryland, using an 8-digit numerical code. These watersheds are equivalent to the HUC 11-digit codes. The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24,000. A new 12-digit watershed file is available from DNR which provides more detailed line work for over 1,100 watersheds which is approximately equivalent to the HUC 14-digit code.",J.B.

Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays.

Studies conducted by MGS of Fenwick, Weaver, and Isle of Wight Shoals show four general patterns of substrate conditions: 1) Shoal crest - generally is restricted to the undisturbed shoal crest at depths less than 35 it (11.2 m) and, has no discernable bedforms; Shoal crests consist of sand with almost no shell material; Coarser gravels are concentrated in areas of greatest wave and current energies, such as along the shoal crest. 2) Flank- bottom class associated With the shoal crest; primarily found along the shoal flanks between -35 ft and -40 ft, representing transitional bottom, from shoal crest to intershoal bottom type; sand, the texture of which may or may not be significantly different than that of the shoal crest; occasional ripples; sand with some shell and other biogenic materials. 3) Intershoal-associated with the deeper sea bottom (> 40 feet), both disturbed (dredged) and undisturbed intershoal areas or troughs; sandy bottom dominated by small ripples ( 40 feet) in trough or intershoal areas; large patches, ~l00 it in diameter, associated with rippled bottom within the dredged area; interpreted to be soft, finer-grained sediment based on low backscatter intensity return; Patch-mat regions occur between shoals that have muddy substrates, abundant patches/mats of worm tube colonies, and shell beds.

f4rx-gar6,Recreational Hunting and Trapping,"Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland’s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.",J.B.

The first component is the updated Green Infrastructure Assessment (circa 2010) which identifies large, contiguous blocks (hubs) of significant forests and wetlands and their connecting corridors. The Green Infrastructure’s hub and corridor network of habitat allows plant and animal migration, reduces forest fragmentation if protected, and provides important ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, cleaning air and water, storing nutrients, and protecting areas against storm and flood damage. The rare species and wildlife habitat component identifies areas that support Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species, rare plant and animal communities, species of Greatest Conservation Need, and wildlife concentrations. The aquatic life hotspots component identifies watersheds supporting freshwater stream ecosystems where conservation is needed to protect and restore areas of high aquatic biodiversity, Tier II regulated streams, and brook trout streams. The water quality protection component identifies sensitive lands such as forests, wetlands, and steep slopes where preservation is important for water quality. The coastal ecosystems component identifies Blue Infrastructure shoreline and watershed protection priorities. These are areas important for sustaining coastal and tidal ecosystems and also identifies land areas important for sustaining spawning and nursery areas for important commercial and recreational fisheries. The climate change adaptation component identifies areas important for sustaining wetlands ecosystems that are changing and moving landward in response to sea level rise. From the ecological baseline, areas that ranked as most important for each of the components were merged to create the Targeted Ecological Areas. Lands that were developed, as identified by the Maryland Department of Planning (2010) were removed from the TEA layer since developed lands are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding. Additionally, lands that are in the 0 foot to 2 foot inundation zone based on the 2011 SLAMM (Maryland Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model) study performed for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City since these areas are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding.",J.B.

This geodatabase contains geologic data from Washington County, Maryland. Data from several geologic quadrangles and two regional scale geologic maps were incorporated into the regional scale geologic feature classes in this geodatabase. Because of the scale of this map, some features were generalized slightly from the quad scale data. Additionally, some corrections were made for accuracy, such as edge matching to resolve ""border faults"". The source data for this map and geodatabase come from maps published by the Maryland Geological Survey from 2001 to the present, as well as one map published in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey. The source maps are Buckeystown (2001), Catoctin Furnace (2004), Frederick (2004), New Windsor (2004), Point of Rocks (2004), Walkersville (2004), Woodsboro (2004), Middletown (2005), Union Bridge (2006), Funkstown (2009), Keedysville, Shepherdstown, Charlestown, and Harpers Ferry (2009), Myersville and Smithsburg (2009), Hagerstown (2013), Mason and Dixon (2013), Clear Spring and Hedgesville (2014), Williamsport (2014), Blue Ridge Summit (2021, in review), Emmitsburg and Taneytown (2021, in review), all 1:24000 quadrangle scale, as well as portions of two regional maps: Geologic Map of Garrett, Allegany, and Western Washington Counties, Maryland (2013), and Geologic Map of the Frederick 30' x 60' Quadrangle, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia (USGS, 2007).

This was done to verify that the graphic representations were accurate. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.
