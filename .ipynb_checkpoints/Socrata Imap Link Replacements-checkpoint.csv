These areas represent the most ecologically valuable areas in the State: they are the best of the best"""". TEAs are preferred for conservation funding through Stateside Program Open Space. This version updates the 2008 TEA layer. The first step in updating TEAs was to create an ecological baseline composed of several ecological databases which included updates of original databases and additional databases developed since 2008.The first component is the updated Green Infrastructure Assessment (circa 2010) which identifies large -  contiguous blocks (hubs) of significant forests and wetlands and their connecting corridors. The Green Infrastructure's hub and corridor network of habitat allows plant and animal migration -  reduces forest fragmentation if protected -  and provides important ecosystem services -  such as biodiversity -  cleaning air and water -  storing nutrients -  and protecting areas against storm and flood damage.The rare species and wildlife habitat component identifies areas that support Rare -  Threatened -  and Endangered Species -  rare plant and animal communities -  species of Greatest Conservation Need -  and wildlife concentrations.The aquatic life hotspots component identifies watersheds supporting freshwater stream ecosystems where conservation is needed to protect and restore areas of high aquatic biodiversity -  Tier II regulated streams -  and brook trout streams.The water quality protection component identifies sensitive lands such as forests -  wetlands -  and steep slopes where preservation is important for water quality.The coastal ecosystems component identifies Blue Infrastructure shoreline and watershed protection priorities.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This data layer shows the locations of NOAA tide gauges in Maryland. Knowledge of the timing and strength of tidal currents is extremely important for safe navigation in coastal waters. Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data -  the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors -  real-time current measurements are preferred.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Bathymetry for Chesapeake Bay was derived from two hundred ninety-seven surveys containing 3 - 178 - 509 soundings. Thirty-five older -  less accurate -  overlapping surveys were entirely omitted before tinning. Partial overlap from other older -  less accurate surveys was also omitted prior to tinning. The surveys used dated from 1859 to 1993. Thirty-six surveys dated from 1859 to 1918 -  thirty-seven from the 1930s -  ninety-one from the 1940s -  sixty- six from the 1950s -  twenty-five from the 1960s -  twenty-four from the 1970s -  fourteen from the 1980s -  and four from the 1990s. The total range of sounding data was 3.7 meters to -50.4 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0.2 and 1.2 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7.5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record) -  followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This data layer contains the Province-level physiographic subdivisions of Maryland in ArcGIS format. The file was developed from components of a detailed digital physiographic map of Maryland by James P. Reger and Emery T. Cleaves -  currently in progress. Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it. The approach for the detailed physiographic map of Maryland is hierarchical and descriptive. Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure -  rock type -  geomorphic history -  and topographic characteristics. Data and subdivisions were compiled at a 1:100 - 000 scale for the detailed state-wide map. The hierarchical classification of the detailed physiographic map (in progress) includes subdivisions as follows -  in descending order (and generally decreasing size): Province -  Section -  Region -  District -  Area. In Maryland there are portions of five physiographic Provinces. In this file -  the polygons reflect Province level subdivision. The polygon feature attribute table has been developed to pertain only to the Provinces level. The table includes information on dominant rock types -  geologic structure -  topographic relief -  and drainage pattern.Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it.  The approach for the detailed physiographic map of Maryland is hierarchical and descriptive.  Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure -  rock type -  geomorphic history -  and topographic characteristics.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. In 2000 -  the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal Zone Management grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal regions of Maryland -- the Chesapeake Bay -  its tributaries -  the coastal bays -  and the Atlantic coast. MGS contracted the services of EarthData International -  Inc. (EDI) -  currently of Frederick -  Md. -  to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation -  which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available -  EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography. DOQQ registration (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System -  NAD 83 -  meters) was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors. Following shoreline extraction or interpretation -  EDI assigned attributes to the vectors based on shoreline type: beach -  vegetated -  structure -  or water's edge. All four categories are linear features -  except 'beach - ' which -  if sufficiently wide -  can be both linear and polygonal. Shorelines were merged into 7.5-minute quadrangles -  provided that the aerial photography on which the DOQQs were based was flown in the same year. MGS used the shorelines to create a series of Shoreline Changes maps. In doing so -  MGS erased the landward edge of beach polygons -  leaving the seaward edge intact as a linear feature. The Geographic Information Services Division of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) merged the shorelines for all of the 7.5-minute quadrangles into a single -  statewide coverage. MGS -  working collaboratively with Towson University's Center for Geographic Sciences (CGIS) -  subsequently used the recent shorelines -  along with historical ones -  as input into a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) program -  the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) (Danforth and Thieler -  1992; Thieler and other...,104,07/28/2016 07:20:00 PM +0000,07/28/2016 7:20:00 PM,Hydrology,"hydr,hydrology,historic,transects,baseline,md,maryland,md imap,vector,dynamic,wfs,wms,kml,dnr,department of natural resources,mgs,maryland geological survey,shoreline changes,shorelines",0,Open Data Administrator,patrick.mcloughlin@maryland.gov,Public Domain,published,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/7186189291744c01ab89ff682bfd4e35_1.kml,7/20/16,Service first issued on 2016-03-30.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. To quantify rates of change (erosion or accretion) along coastal and estuarine shorelines in Maryland -  the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) -  in conjunction with Towson University's Center for Geographic Information Sciences (CGIS) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) -  installed and ran a computer program -  the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) -  using as input a series of digital shoreline vectors dating from 1841-1995. Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright -  1975) -  (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS) -  a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -  and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a 'baseline' landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines -  inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline -  and cast straight-line transects from each node -  perpendicular to the baseline -  across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs -  DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect.

Stream Waders is the volunteer component of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS).Goals of Stream Waders are: to increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; to improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; to educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and to provide quality assured information on stream quality to state -  local -  and federal agencies -  environmental organizations -  and others.Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other stream sampling programs in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); about 70 square miles each) -  while Stream Waders volunteers sample at a smaller scale subwatersheds at the 12-digit HUC; about 8 square miles each). Thus -  Stream Waders data should help 'fill the gaps' left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS. Stream Waders sample -  for the most part -  in the sameoverall watersheds each year where MBSS crews sample.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Maryland -  through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program -  is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access -  land acquisition -  and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters -  maximizing efficiency -  and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing -  aquaculture -  transport -  habitat for wildlife -  and recreation -  among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses -  as well as Maryland's growing coastal population -  the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist -  but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

In 2007 -  State leaders in Maryland took a bold step in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay with the creation of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund (Trust Fund). The Trust Fund allows Maryland to accelerate Bay restoration by focusing limited financial resources on the most effective non-point source pollution control projects. Dollars for the Trust Fund are generated through motor fuel tax and rental car tax in Maryland. It is anticipated that when fully-funded -  the Trust Fund will generate $50M annually.

Coastal storm and flood events may increase the likelihood of danger or damage to life and property as a consequence of inundation and shoreline erosion. These hazards are caused by storms and exacerbated by sea level rise. The Community Flood Risk Areas represent residential areas at risk to coastal flooding where populations may be less equipped to prepare for -  respond to -  or recover from a coastal hazard event. Risk Areas are ranked from 1 to 5 to indicate relative risk -  with 1 indicating very low risk and 5 indicating very high risk. Risk rankings incorporate population density -  social parameters (i.e. age -  income -  language proficiency) -  and probability of exposure to a flood hazard event in any one given year. 2013 US Census Bureau American Community Survey -  2010 Maryland Department of Planning land use land cover -  and effective FEMA floodplain data as of December 2015 were used to identify and rank risk areas.

Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. The Marsh Protection Potential Index (MPPI) ranks Maryland's coastal marshes by their ability to protect vulnerable communities from coastal hazards. To do so -  we identified five key questions to assess each marsh: How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards?Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat?Is the marsh located where there are people to protect? Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats?Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels?Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources -  we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then -  the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating -  which ranks the protective ability of over 14 - 000 marshes statewide.It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes -  rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh -  nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition -  the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity -  ecosystem health -  rare species -  recreation value -  or water quality services are often important to stakeholders -  and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement -  not replace -  the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats.

Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March -  2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) -  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS). The statements -  finding and recommendations are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Natural Capital Project (NatCap) -  CCS and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) all contributed to the production of this dataset.

Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast -  including Atlantic -  Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index -  representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology -  elevation -  sea level rise -  wave power -  storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest -  marsh -  dune -  oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March -  2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.

Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for Hydrologic unit boundaries define the aerial extent of surface water drainage to a point. Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the United States. This system divides the country into 21 Regions -  222 Subregions -  352 Accounting Units -  and 2 - 149 Cataloging Units based on surface hydrologic features. The smallest USGS unit (8-digit HU) is approximately 448 - 000 acres. During the late 1970's the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) -  formerly the Soil Conservation Service -  initiated a national program to further subdivide HU's into smaller watersheds for water resources planning. A 3-digit extension was added to the 8-digit identification. By the early 1980's this 11-digit HU mapping was completed for most of the U.S. These data demonstrate Maryland's watersheds as represented by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code denoted by an 11-digit numerical code. The watersheds were defined using contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. The state has been divided into 138 watersheds that are identified by Maryland -  using an 8-digit numerical code. These watersheds are equivalent to the HUC 11-digit codes. The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24 - 000. A new 12-digit watershed file is available from DNR which provides more detailed line work for over 1 - 100 watersheds which is approximately equivalent to the HUC 14-digit code.

The DNR Lands data (part of Technology Toolbox Protected Lands data set) consists of mapped information that represent those lands that are owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.Utilizing various land protection programs and funding sources -  the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has preserved environmentally important lands through the use of perpetual conservation easements. The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers -  establish wetlands -  protect highly erodible land -  and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The digital segmented network based on watershed boundaries -  ERF1-2 -  includes enhancements to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's River Reach File 1 (RF1) (USEPA -  1996; DeWald and others -  1985) to support national and regional-scale surface water-quality modeling. Alexander and others (1999) developed ERF1 -  which assessed the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and calculated the mean water time-of-travel in river reaches and reservoirs. ERF1-2 serves as the foundation for SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions (of nutrient transport) On Watershed) modeling. Within the context of a Geographic Information System -  SPARROW estimates the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous U.S. with outflow concentrations of several nutrients -  including total nitrogen and total phosphorus -  (Smith -  R.A. -  Schwarz -  G.E. -  and Alexander -  R.B. -  1997). This version of the network expands on ERF1 (version 1.2; Alexander et al. 1999) -  and includes the incremental and total drainage area derived from 1-kilometer (km) elevation data for North America. Previous estimates of the water time-of-travel were recomputed for reaches with water- quality monitoring sites that included two reaches. The mean flow and velocity estimates for these split reaches are based on previous estimation methods (Alexander et al. -  1999) and are unchanged in ERF1-2. Drainage area calculations provide data used to estimate the contribution of a given nutrient to the outflow. Data estimates depend on the accuracy of node connectivity. Reaches split at water- quality or pesticide-monitoring sites indicate the source point for estimating the contribution and transport of nutrients and their loads throughout the watersheds. The ERF1-2 coverage extends the earlier ERF1 coverage by providing digital-elevation-model (DEM-based estimates of reach drainage area founded on the 1-kilometer data for North America (Verdin -  1996; ...,151,07/27/2016 05:00:00 PM +0000,07/27/2016 5:00:00 PM,Hydrology,"hydr,hydrology,rivers,streams,lakes,waterbodies,maryland,md imap,md,usgs,us geological survey,dnr,department of natural resources,sha,state highway administration,dynamic,vector,wms,wfs,kml",0,Open Data Administrator,patrick.mcloughlin@maryland.gov,Public Domain,published,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/9ba87d5942744b3bb61c78dd22c76564_0.kml,7/20/16,Service first issued on 2016-03-30.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The purpose of creating this file was to use MesoMap to create high-resolution wind maps of the state and to provide wind resource data in a format enabling the assessment of potential wind development sites in a GIS. By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions -  they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition -  they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location -  mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower -  LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data. Although it is believed to represent an accurate overall picture of the wind energy resource -  estimates at any location should be confirmed by measurement.

Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast -  including Atlantic -  Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index -  representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology -  elevation -  sea level rise -  wave power -  storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest -  marsh -  dune -  oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR's Community Flood Risk Areas (March -  2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) -  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS). The statements -  finding and recommendations are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features -  such as streets -  roads -  streams -  and railroad tracks -  and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city -  town -  township -  and county limits -  and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example -  a block in a city bounded by streets. However -  census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas -  rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints -  along with roads and water features -  to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result -  all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area -  so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.

This application is based on their Marine Mammal and Seabird Computer Database Analysis System (MMS-CDAS). The origin of the underlying data is a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service aerial survey conducted between December -  2001 and March -  2003. The source data were collected on-transect (120m width -  60 m each side) for transects conducted in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay -  in Delaware Bay -  and in offshore waters from the beach outward. Aerial surveys of waterbirds were flown to at least 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore from northern New Jersey to the Virginia / North Carolina border. All waterbird species in the USFWS database from winter surveys only were exported to density blocks. Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects. The spatial extent of the database (and thus of this data set) is from the Virginia/North Carolina border to the Hudson Canyon (including Delaware Bay and the lowest part of Chesapeake Bay).

The interim Sustainable Communities designation will continue for a transition period and local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued designation. The term of the transition period is as follows: Existing Designated Neighborhoods will automatically become Sustainable Communities effective June 1 -  2010. The designation will continue for a period of 24 months -  during which time local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued Sustainable Communities designation. Community Legacy Areas designated prior to January 1 -  2008 will become Sustainable Community for 24 months after June 1 -  2010. Existing Community Legacy Areas designated on or after January 1 -  2008 will be considered Sustainable Communities for a period of 36 months after June 1 -  2010. An application procedure is being developed for local governments to request continued Sustainable Communities designation beyond the transition period. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will begin accepting applications for Sustainable Communities in the Fall of 2010. Applications for Sustainable Communities designation will be reviewed by an interagency panel led by DHCD and must be approved by the Governor's Smart Growth Subcabinet. Once approved -  newly designated Sustainable Communities (those that apply after June 1 -  2010) will retain their designation for a period of five years. Sustainable Communities also include designated Transit Oriented Development Zones (TOD's) and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Zones. These areas are automatically considered Sustainable Communities effective June 1 -  2010 and do not need to reapply for continued designation.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks -  less than 2 square miles -  where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose -  'broadband service' is the provision -  on either a commercial or non-commercial basis -  of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users -  or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose -  an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party -  institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs) -  special access lines -  or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed sp...,98,07/22/2016 07:32:00 PM +0000,07/22/2016 7:32:00 PM,Utility,"utility,communications,broadband,providers,maryland,md,wms,wfs,vector,dynamic,su,tu,salisbury university,towson university,esrgc,cgis,towson university center for gis,eastern shore regional gis cooperative,util,utilities communication,maryland broadband cooperative,maryland broadband mapping initiative,census,census blocks,md imap",0,Open Data Administrator,patrick.mcloughlin@maryland.gov,Public Domain,published,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/8c736807b7af4ee593b4566a7e4b4153_0.kml,7/20/16,Service first issued on 2014-06-25.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services -  such as cleaning the air -  filtering water -  storing and cycling nutrients -  conserving soils -  regulating climate -  and maintaining hydrologic function -  are all provided by the existing expanses of forests -  wetlands -  and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services -  like forest products -  fish and wildlife -  and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure -  we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology -  and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife -  for example) -  how a given place fits into a larger system -  the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas -  the importance of coordinating local -  state and even interstate p...,99,07/22/2016 06:58:00 PM +0000,07/22/2016 6:58:00 PM,Biota,"md,maryland,environment,biota,hubs,corridors,green infrastructure,md imap,biot,dynamic,wms,vector,dnr,department of natural resources",0,Open Data Administrator,patrick.mcloughlin@maryland.gov,Public Domain,published,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/7a66e97515cf481499a392d296e315c9_0.kml,7/20/16,Service first issued on 2016-03-29.

The resulting boundary area files were intended to improve the cartographic quality and accuracy of the ZIP code boundary area files derived from the U.S. Census Bureau's post 1990 Census TIGER\Line Files (based on the Census Bureau's ZIP code tabulation areas -  ZCTAs). Subsequent iterative improvements to the ZIP Code boundary area files have been made using premise address information associated with mapped parcel records as provided in the Maryland Department of Planning's MdProperty View GIS tax map and parcel record DVD product.

In 1987 -  the Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed by states within the Chesapeake Bay region including Maryland -  Pennsylvania -  Virginia and the District of Columbia. This agreement included commitments for providing fish passage within each state: to provide for fish passage at dams -  and remove stream blockages wherever necessary to restore passage for migratory fish."""" With this humble beginning -  the Chesapeake Bay states set a goal to reopen a total of 1 - 357 miles of historical spawning grounds by the year 2003. Maryland's portion of this goal is to reopen 388.65 miles of stream. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Fish Passage Program has taken this commitment very seriously; to date the Program has completed 61 projects -  reopening a total 348.9 miles of upstream spawning habitat. Several projects scheduled to be completed by 2003 will allow the Program to not only meet but also exceed the goal set forth by the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Meeting this goal has been a cooperative effort between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources -  State Highway Administration -  National Marine Fisheries Service - National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration -  Department of Interior - US Fish & Wildlife -  Environmental Protection Agency -  Chesapeake Bay Program -  Chesapeake Bay Foundation -  University Maryland and a multitude of others including private citizens -  local watershed groups and local governments.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_LivingResources/FeatureServer/0 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively the """"Data"""") is provided ""as is"" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.

These areas were then overlane with a point file created from lat/long collected during the surveys conducted by O'dell -  Mowrer -  and Uphoff of MD DNR Fisheries Service. This was done to verify that the graphic representations were accurate. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.

The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs.

The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services -  such as cleaning the air -  filtering water -  storing and cycling nutrients -  conserving soils -  regulating climate -  and maintaining hydrologic function -  are all provided by the existing expanses of forests -  wetlands -  and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services -  like forest products -  fish and wildlife -  and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure -  we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology -  and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife -  for example) -  how a given place fits into a larger system -  the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas -  the importance of coordina...,99,07/22/2016 04:43:00 PM +0000,07/22/2016 4:43:00 PM,Biota,"md,maryland,environment,biota,hubs,corridors,green infrastructure,md imap,biot,dynamic,wms,vector,dnr,department of natural resources",0,Open Data Administrator,patrick.mcloughlin@maryland.gov,Public Domain,published,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/01cd3e4c9b4a4a72a6368bc147e94dfb_1.kml,7/20/16,Service first issued on 2016-03-29.

The resulting buffer layers were clipped with a forest cover layer to determine the presence and absence of forest in those buffers. The forest cover layer was derived from a tree canopy layer developed by the Community College of Baltimore County -  Catonsville -  Geography Department. The tree canopy was developed using 2007 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) color infra-red 1-meter imagery. To determine areas forested -  contiguous areas of tree cover less than 1 acre were removed from the dataset and then used for clipping the stream and shoreline buffers.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_Forests/FeatureServer/1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively ""the Data"") is provided ""as is"" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats -  because of their depth -  go undetected by aerial imagery.

Find more information at  http://imap.maryland.gov. These data sets exist in raster and vector formats. The areas in this data set were determined from USGS Terrapin studies (for more information contact Paula Henry -  410-465-0550 or paula.henry@usgs.gov) -  DNR studies conducted by Margaret Whilden -  and a terrapin study conducted by Willem Roosenburg (contact information can be acquired from Harley Speir of DNR Fisheries Service). For extent acquracies please contact the project lead for each study. Secondary habitats were delineated using sandy beach data from VIMS and salinity data from Lee Karrh of DNR. Sandy beach areas were selected and exported from the source file and then combined with the salinity data to determine sensitivity importance levels. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_LivingResources/FeatureServer/1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (collectively ""the Data"") is provided ""as is"" without warranty of any kind either expressed implied or statutory.

Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. In 2007 -  State leaders in Maryland took a bold step in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay with the creation of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund (Trust Fund). The Trust Fund allows Maryland to accelerate Bay restoration by focusing limited financial resources on the most effective non-point source pollution control projects. Dollars for the Trust Fund are generated through motor fuel tax and rental car tax in Maryland. It is anticipated that when fully-funded -  the Trust Fund will generate $50M annually. This file depicts the Bay Trust Fund current priority zones. Priority zone areas were developed using information from the USGS SPARROW model and local knowledge and expertise. Coastal Bays watersheds were prioritized based on the expertise of scientists in that region. - SPARROW is a regression-based model for regional interpretation of water quality monitoring data. SPARROW discriminates which watersheds are likely to contribute the highest nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay. - The Biological Restoration Initiative (BRI) targeting identifies biologically impaired waters that demonstrate a high potential for removal from Marylands 303(d) list of impaired waters. Their selection is based on evaluation using the Biological Listing Methodology results listed in Marylands 2008 Integrated Report -  which sets a threshold for degradation within Marylands non-tidal freshwater streams using the index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores from sampled fish and benthic communities. These watersheds have been targeted primarily for 319(h) grant program -  which has a goal of delisting impaired surface waters. - The Atlantic Coastal Bay watersheds were selected based on the pattern of trajectories of the water quality index (dissolved oxygen -  chlorophyll a -  total nitrogen -  total phosphorus) between 2001-2006 (http://ian.umces.edu/press/books/publication/93/shifting_sands_envi ronmental_and_cultu...,63,07/22/2016 03:07:00 PM +0000,07/22/2016 3:07:00 PM,Energy and Environment,"md,maryland,md imap,dnr,maryland department of natural resources,chesapeake bay trust fund,trust fund,environment,envl,wms,wfs,vector,dynamic",0,Open Data Administrator,patrick.mcloughlin@maryland.gov,Public Domain,published,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/52f2a425d6fe438a95e4b9f4334eaa6d_0.kml,7/20/16,Service first issued on 2016-06-16.

Find more information at  http://imap.maryland.gov. The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD) -  which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard -  necessarily -  to population. Places always nest within a State -  but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city -  town -  village -  or borough -  but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name -  but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State -  local -  and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1 -  2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).Feature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Demographics/MD_CensusDesignatedAreas/FeatureServer/1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS: The Spatial Data and the information therein (colle...,96,07/21/2016 06:24:00 PM +0000,07/21/2016 6:24:00 PM,Demographic,"mdp,census designated places,maryland department of planning,2010,maryland,md,census urban areas,wfs,wms,md imap,kml",0,Open Data Administrator,patrick.mcloughlin@maryland.gov,Public Domain,published,ArcGIS Online for Maryland,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/008cbfc9d1d34644864b6b0110f318ab_1.kml,7/20/16,Service first issued on 2016-02-09.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This file (SWSUB8) is a statewide digital watershed file. It depicts the State with 138 separate watersheds each with an 8-digit numeric code. The file was created primarily for State and Federal agency use. The creation of this file goes back many years and involved several State and Federal agencies. This file was derived from a more detailed watershed file (Maryland's Third-Order Watershed). The process used to create this file is consistent with the elevation contour information found on the US Geological Survey's 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and the Maryland Department of the Environment's watershed location and naming conventions. This file is similar -  but not identical -  to the US Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC11) watershed file. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p.1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. Some watershed drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area Watersheds were split to maintain a maximum size of 15 - 000 acres.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Traffic monitoring data is a strategic resource for SHA and Maryland's Department of Transportation. The data is essential in the planning -  design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991 -  which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA's long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent -  continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts.The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland's roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs -  located throughout Maryland. To date -  four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday -  respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers -  starting in 2006 -  to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where '0' represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014) -  '1' represents the count taken in 2013 -  '2' represents the count taken in 2012 -  '3' represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.

https://opendata.maryland.gov/d/ctg2-hcpq,ctg2-hcpq,TRUE,FALSE,,opendata.maryland.gov,href,MD iMAP: Maryland Annual Average Daily Traffic - Annual Average Daily Traffic (SHA Statewide AADT Lines),This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. Traffic monitoring data is a strategic resource for SHA and Maryland's Department of Transportation. The data is essential in the planning -  design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991 -  which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA's long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent -  continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts.The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland's roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs -  located throughout Maryland. To date -  four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday -  respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers -  starting in 2006 -  to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where '0' represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014) -  '1' represents the count taken in 2013 -  '2' represents the count taken in 2012 -  '3' represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.
